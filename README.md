## Spam vs HAM (Sentiment Analysis)
This project focuses on entity-level sentiment analysis using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) applied to a dataset comprising SMS messages. The primary objective is to discern the sentiment of each message concerning a specific entity. The dataset is labeled into two classes: "Spam" and "Ham."

### Dataset Overview:

The dataset encompasses a diverse collection of SMS messages, each associated with a particular entity. The task involves categorizing these messages into two classes:

Spam: Messages expressing a negative sentiment or unfavorable opinion about the entity.
Ham: Messages conveying a positive sentiment or favorable opinion about the entity.

### Objective:

The main goal of this project is to leverage the power of ANN to develop a robust sentiment analysis model. By training the network on the provided dataset, the model aims to accurately classify messages as either "Spam" or "Ham" based on their sentiment toward the specified entity.
